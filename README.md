Supplementary Materials for the paper "Investigating the impact of Data Monitoring Committee recommendations on the probability of trial success".

The R scripts allow to produce plots like the ones in the paper. Script1 is used to produce the data. Script2 should be used AFTER Script 1 to plot the results.
In Script1, under line 78:# Study parameters, modify the parameters to change values for alpha, beta, sample size, IF, etc...
In Script1, under line 117:# Alpha spent at interim, choose the type of alpha spending function to use by commenting out the undesired functions.

The pdf file "plots_for_other_IF.pdf" containts plots for the 3 examples discussed in the paper, but with information fractions equal to 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8 (instead of only IF=0.5 like in the paper).
